Example Three is $MA(2) \times AR(1)_{12}$.

```python
th1 = 0.8
th2 = 0.6
ma_coeffs = np.array([1, th1, th2])
ph = 0.8
ar_coeffs = np.zeros(13)
ar_coeffs[0] = 1
ar_coeffs[12] = -ph
#ar_coeffs = [1, -ph]
#ar_coeffs = [1, 0, 0, 0, -ph]
#th2 = 0.8
#ma_coeffs = [1, th, th2]
L = 60
corrs = arma_acf(ar = ar_coeffs, ma = ma_coeffs, lags = L)
par_corrs = arma_pacf(ar = ar_coeffs, ma = ma_coeffs, lags = L)
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize = (12, 5))
ax1.stem(range(L), corrs)
ax1.set(title = 'Theoretical ACF', xlabel = 'Lag h', ylabel = 'Autocorrelation')
ax1.axhline(0, lw = 0.5)
#ax1.set_xticks([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20])

ax2.stem(range(L), par_corrs)
ax2.set(title = 'Theoretical PACF', xlabel = 'Lag h', ylabel = 'Partial Autocorrelation')
ax2.axhline(0, lw = 0.5)
#ax2.set_xticks([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20])
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Looking at the seasonal lags (12, 24, 36, ...) in the PACF, we can clearly see only one spike suggesting $AR(1)_{12}$. Looking at lags 1, 2, 3, ... in the ACF, we see two spikes suggesting $MA(2)$. The overall model can be guessed as $MA(2) \times AR(1)_{12}$.
