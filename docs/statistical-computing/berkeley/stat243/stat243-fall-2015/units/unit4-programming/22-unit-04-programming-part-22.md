sam <- **new** ("bear", name = "Z%a B''*", age = 20, birthday = **as.Date** ('91-08-03')) sam@age <- 150 _# so our validity check is not foolproof_

To deal with this latter issue of the user mucking with the slots, it’s recommended when using OOP that slots only be accessible through methods that operate on the object, e.g., a _setAge()_ method, and then check the validity of the supplied age within _setAge()_ .

Here’s how we create generic and class-specific methods. Note that in some cases the generic will already exist.

_# generic method_ **setGeneric** ("isVoter", **function** (object, ...) { **standardGeneric** ("isVoter") }) ## [1] "isVoter" _# class-specific method_ isVoter.bear <- **function** (object){ **if** (object@age > 17){ **cat** (object@name, "is of voting age.\n") } **else cat** (object@name, "is not of voting age.\n") } **setMethod** (isVoter, signature = **c** ("bear"), definition = isVoter.bear) ## [1] "isVoter" ## attr(,"package") ## [1] ".GlobalEnv" **isVoter** (yog) ## Yogi is of voting age.

We can have method signatures involve multiple objects. Here’s some syntax where we’d fill in the function body with appropriate code - perhaps the plus operator would create a child. setMethod(‘+‘, signature = c("bear", "bear"), definition = function(bear1, bear2) { }

As with S3, classes can inherit from one or more other classes. Chambers calls the class that is being inherited from a _superclass_ .

28

**setClass** ("grizzly_bear", **representation** ( number_of_people_eaten = "numeric" ), contains = "bear" ) sam <- **new** ("grizzly_bear", name = "Sam", age = 20, birthday = **as.Date** ('91-08-03'), number_of_people_eaten = 3) **isVoter** (sam) ## Sam is of voting age. **is** (sam, "bear") ## [1] TRUE

For a more relevant example suppose we had spatially-indexed time series. We could have a time series class, a spatial location class, and a “location time series” class that inherits from both. Be careful that there are not conflicts in the slots or methods from the multiple classes. For conflicting methods, you can define a method specific to the new class to deal with this. Also, if you define your own _initialize()_ method, you’ll need to be careful that you account for any initialization of the superclass(es) and for any classes that might inherit from your class (see help on _new()_ and Chambers, p. 360).

You can inherit from other S4 classes (which need to be defined or imported into the environment in which your class is created), but not S3 classes. You can inherit (at most one) of the basic R types, but not environments, symbols, or other non-standard types. You can use S3 classes in slots, but this requires that the S3 class be declared as an S4 class. To do this, you create S4 versions of S3 classes use _setOldClass()_ - this creates a virtual class. This has been done, for example, for the _data.frame_ class:

**showClass** ("data.frame") ## Class "data.frame" [package "methods"] ## ## Slots: ## ## Name: .Data names
