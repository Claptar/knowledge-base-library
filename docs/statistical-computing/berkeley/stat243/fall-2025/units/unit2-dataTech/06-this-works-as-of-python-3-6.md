# This works as of Python 3.6.

**Source:** [`units/unit2-dataTech.qmd`](https://github.com/berkeley-stat243/fall-2025/blob/035a19ebd7ab88cffca907cade6d40212d575a1f/units/unit2-dataTech.qmd) · **Licence:** CC BY 4.0 · Converted 2026-09-14 from `.qmd` (lossless)

print(f"Let's add {val1} and {val2}.")
num1 = 1/3
print("Let's add the %s numbers %.5f and %15.7f."
       %('floating point', num1 ,32+1/7))
```

Or to insert into a file:
```python
#| eval: false
file_path = os.path.join('/tmp', 'tmp.txt')
with open(file_path, 'a') as file:
     file.write("Let's add the %s numbers %.5f and %15.7f."
                %('floating point', num1 ,32+1/7))

```

`round` is another option, but it's often better to directly control the printing format.
