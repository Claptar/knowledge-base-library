# Parallel job submission

If you are submitting a job that uses multiple nodes, you may need to carefully specify the resources you need. The key flags for use in your job script are:

 - `--nodes` (or `-N`): indicates the number of nodes to use
 - `--ntasks-per-node`: indicates the number of tasks (i.e., processes) one wants to run on each node
 - `--cpus-per-task` (or `-c`): indicates the number of cpus to be used for each task

In addition, in some cases it can make sense to use the `--ntasks` (or `-n`) option to indicate the total number of tasks and let the scheduler determine how many nodes and tasks per node are needed. In general `--cpus-per-task` will be 1 except when running threaded code.

Here's an example job script for a job that uses Spark for parallelizing over multiple nodes:

       #!/bin/bash
       # Job name:
       #SBATCH --job-name=test
       #
       # Account:
       #SBATCH --account=ic_stat243
       #
       # Partition:
       #SBATCH --partition=savio
       #
       # Number of tasks needed for use case (example):
       #SBATCH --nodes=2
       #
       # Processors per task:
       #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
       #
       # Wall clock limit:
       #SBATCH --time=00:00:30
       #
       ## Command(s) to run (example):
       module load java spark
       source /global/home/groups/allhands/bin/spark_helper.sh
       spark-start
       spark-submit --master $SPARK_URL $HOME/stat243-fall-2017/units/test_batch.py
       spark-stop

When you write your code, you may need to specify information about the number of cores to use. SLURM will provide a variety of variables that you can use in your code so that it adapts to the resources you have requested rather than being hard-coded.

In addition to SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE here are some of the variables that may be useful: SLURM_NTASKS, SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK, SLURM_NODELIST, SLURM_NNODES.
