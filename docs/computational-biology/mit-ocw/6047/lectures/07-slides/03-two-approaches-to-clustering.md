• Partitioning (e.g. k-means)

   - Divides objects into non-overlapping clusters such that each data object is in exactly one subset

- Agglomerative (e.g. hierarchical clustering) – A set of nested clusters organized as a hierarchy

###### **Today: Gene Expression Clustering & Classification**

###### **1. Introduction to gene expression analysis**

   - Technology: microarrays vs. RNAseq. Resulting data matrices

   - Supervised (Clustering) vs. unsupervised (classification) learning

**2. K-means clustering (clustering by partitioning)**

   - Algorithmic formulation: Update rule, optimality criterion. Fuzzy k-means.

   - Machine learning formulation: Generative models, Expectation Maximization.

**3. Hierarchical Clustering (clustering by agglomeration)**

   - Basic algorithm, Distance measures. Evaluating clustering results

**4. Naïve Bayes classification (generative approach to classification)** – Discriminant function: class priors, and class-conditional distributions

   - Training and testing, Combine mult features, Classification in practice

**5. (optional) Support Vector Machines (discriminative approach)** – SVM formulation, Margin maximization, Finding the support vectors

   - Non-linear discrimination, Kernel functions, SVMs in practice
