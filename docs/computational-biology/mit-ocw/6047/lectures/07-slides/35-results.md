##### Bringing Clustering and Classification Together

###### **Semi-Supervised Learning**


Common Scenario

- Few labeled

- Many unlabeled

- Structured data

What if we cluster first?

Then clusters can help us classify

###### **Today: Gene Expression Clustering & Classification**

###### **1. Introduction to gene expression analysis**

   - Technology: microarrays vs. RNAseq. Resulting data matrices

   - Supervised (Clustering) vs. unsupervised (classification) learning

**2. K-means clustering (clustering by partitioning)**

   - Algorithmic formulation: Update rule, optimality criterion. Fuzzy k-means.

   - Machine learning formulation: Generative models, Expectation Maximization.

**3. Hierarchical Clustering (clustering by agglomeration)**

   - Basic algorithm, Distance measures. Evaluating clustering results

**4. Naïve Bayes classification (generative approach to classification)** – Discriminant function: class priors, and class-conditional distributions

   - Training and testing, Combine mult features, Classification in practice

**5. (optional) Support Vector Machines (discriminative approach)** – SVM formulation, Margin maximization, Finding the support vectors

   - Non-linear discrimination, Kernel functions, SVMs in practice
